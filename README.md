4.  ***3 strengths/3 weaknesses***
* ****strength****
I have good visual design skills, strengthened by two visual design courses at SDCE.
* ****strength****
I have good communication skills for technical topics I have a good understanding of.
* ****strength****
Patience
* ****weakness****
I have difficulty getting started on tasks that seem overwhelming.
* ****weakness****
I have trouble transfering visual design skills to website development. I believe this will improve with becoming a more proficient programmer.
* ****weakness****
Sometimes reluctant to speak or ask questions if I don't understand something. I have gotten better at this over the past few years
5.  ***elevator pitch***
I've completed courses and certificate programs in web design, programming, and information technology over the last three years. I have a chemistry degree and worked in manufacturing and process development at biotech companies. I then earned a Teaching Credential and worked as a classroom teacher. Iâ€™m looking for a job that will put my skills as a educator and science communicator to work building websites and application to promote learning and understanding, particularly in science education.
